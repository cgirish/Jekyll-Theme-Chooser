### Vertically align an image or element inside div

How it works:

1. When you have two inline-block elements near each other, you can align each to other's side, so with vertical-align: middle you'll get something like this:
2. When you have a block with fixed height (in px, em or other absolute unit), you can set the height of inner blocks in %.
3. So, adding one inline-block with height: 100% in a block with fixed height would align another inline-block element in it (<img/> in your case) vertically near it.

```css
.loader-container {
  height: 250px;
  text-align: center;

  img {
    vertical-align: middle;
  }

  &:before {
    content: "";
    height: 100%;
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: middle;
  }
}
```
